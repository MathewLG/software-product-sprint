        <p>My name is Mathew Lopez, I am from Guadalajara, México and I'm computer science student at Tec de Monterrey campus Guadalajara. 
        Before college, I went to a technical highschool, where I graduated as a Mechatronics technician.
        I like to listen to music and play the violin. In fact, I am part of the mariachi at my university.

        <h3>SIGHT</h3>
        <p>
          SIGHT is a personal project. I started it as my grade as Mechatronics technician. 
          It consists on adapting hardware and software in order to help people with visual disability to make easier the process of learning how to use a computer. 
          The first product I've made is a computer keyboard with braille. For which I decided to use mustard seeds in order to make it more ecological.
          Here is a picture of the making of the first prototype for the SIGHT keyboard:
