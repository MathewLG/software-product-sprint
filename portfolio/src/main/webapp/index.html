      <p id="introduction">My name is Mathew Lopez, I am from Guadalajara, México and I'm studying computer science student at Tec de Monterrey campus Guadalajara.

              <h3>SIGHT</h3>
              <p>
              SIGHT is a personal project. I started it as my grade as Mechatronics technician. 
              It consists on adapting hardware and software in order to help people with visual disability to make easier the process of learning how to use a computer. 
              The first product I've made is a computer keyboard with braille. For which I decided to use mustard seeds in order to make it more ecological.
              Here is a picture of the making of the first prototipe for the SIGHT keyboard:
