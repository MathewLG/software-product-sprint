      <p>My name is Mathew Lopez, I am computer science student at Tec de Monterrey. <br>
        Before college, I went to a technical highschool, where I graduated as a Mechatronics technician.  <br>
        I like to listen to music and play the violin. In fact, I am part of the mariachi at my university. <br>

      <p>I have worked in some cool projects.</p>
      <ul>
          <li><h3>SIGHT</h3></li>
          <p>
              SIGHT is a personal project. I started it as my grade as Mechatronics technician. <br>
              It consists on adapting hardware and software in order to help people with visual disability to make easier the process of learning how to use a computer. <br>
              The first product I've made is a computer keyboard with braille. For which I decided to use mustard seeds in order to make it more ecological. <br>
              Here is a picture of the making of the first prototipe for the SIGHT keyboard: <br> <br>
